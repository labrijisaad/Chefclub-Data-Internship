**Welcome** to the repository that captures my journey as a **Data Engineer / Data Scientist** intern at **Chefclub**, a respected digital cooking brand üçΩÔ∏è based in Paris.

## Overview üåü

- **Company**: Chefclub
- **Duration**: January 2023 - July 2023 (6 months)
- **Location**: Paris, √éle-de-France, France
- **Type**: Data Engineer / Data Scientist Internship

## Objective üöÄ

My main focus during this internship was to **strengthen Chefclub's data groundwork** by refining how we gather, store, and study information. This mission aimed to help the company effectively use data from social media. I got hands-on with a toolkit that included **Data Engineering, Cloud Computing, Data Science, and Data Analytics**.

## Accomplishments üèÜ

Throughout the internship, I achieved the following milestones:

1. **`YouTube Data Retrieval System`**: I conceptualized and implemented a YouTube data retrieval system, utilizing a range of technologies such as Airflow, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, GitHub, the YouTube Analytics API, and SQL. This system automates the collection and storage of performance data from Chefclub's YouTube channels, feeding it into BigQuery and Cloud Storage. Moreover, it generates dynamic reports in Looker Studio and financial reports in Google Sheets. The architecture of the system is visually depicted below:

3. **`Forecasting Facebook Posts Performance in Slack`**: I developed and integrated an automated machine learning model using Airflow, BigQuery, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, and Docker. This model, updated daily, delivers forecasts of Facebook post performance based on historical page health. It is integrated with a Google Cloud Function for Slack communication. The workflow and integration process are presented below:
